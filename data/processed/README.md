# Processed Data Folder


- `processed_ap` - This dataframe contains the shots and shots on goal of each team in each of their regular seasons. The data is grouped by the team and the year. The sum of all the shots and shots on goal for each player gives the total for each column. This will be used to compare the shots on goals and shots with the goal differential of processed_at.

- `processed_ap` - This dataframe contains all the first ranked teams in each of the eligible years (for my research question, meaning more than 30 games played in the season). The dataframe is sorted by highest goal differential to lowest.
