This data was found on Kaggle and was provided by Joseph Kohr. He scrapped data from the Major League Soccer website for player data and fbref, a statistics site dedicated to both women's and men's soccer competitions. Data was also taken from espn and wikipedia and it contains all matches, goalscorers, teams and players from 1996 to now. The dataset also includes all statistics relevant to the games, year, and players. Kohr scrapped the data using code. 
## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We hope to be able to better interpet and appreciate the statistics of the MLS. Both partners have a great interests in soccer and while both play and watch the game, neither of us have ever analyzed the statistics before. We both want to explore how previous league winners in the past compare to league winners now. We know the league has changed a lot since 1996, so it will be interesting to see how the league, players, and teams have evolved.
